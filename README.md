> [!NOTE]  
> Applio will no longer receive frequent updates. Going forward, development will focus mainly on security patches, dependency updates, and occasional feature improvements. This is because the project is already stable and mature with limited room for further improvements. Pull requests are still welcome and will be reviewed.

## Docker Support

Applio provides full Docker support with Docker Compose for easy deployment and management, especially useful for NAS systems and container orchestration platforms like Portainer.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10+ and Docker Compose v2.0+
- For GPU support: NVIDIA Docker runtime and compatible GPU drivers

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio.git
   cd Applio
   ```

2. **Copy and configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your preferred settings
   ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   # CPU-only version
   docker compose up -d
   
   # OR GPU-enabled version (requires NVIDIA Docker)
   docker compose --profile gpu up -d
   ```

4. **Access Applio:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6969`

### Configuration Options

The `.env` file contains configuration options:

- `APPLIO_HOST`: Host interface (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `APPLIO_PORT`: Port number (default: 6969)
- `APPLIO_SHARE`: Enable public sharing (default: false)
- `APPLIO_DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (default: false)
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: GPU selection for GPU profile

### Volume Persistence

The Docker setup automatically creates persistent volumes for:
- `applio_logs`: Application logs
- `applio_models`: AI models
- `applio_audio`: Audio files
- `applio_pretrained`: Pre-trained models
- `applio_weights`: Model weights
- `applio_cache`: Application cache
- `applio_config`: Configuration files

### Portainer Stack Deployment

For Portainer users, you can deploy Applio as a stack:

1. In Portainer, go to "Stacks" ‚Üí "Add Stack"
2. Choose "Repository" and enter: `https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio.git`
3. Set the compose file path to `docker-compose.yaml`
4. Configure environment variables as needed
5. Deploy the stack

**App Template:** You can also use the included `portainer-app-template.json` for easier deployment through Portainer's app templates feature.

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Start with GPU support
docker compose --profile gpu up -d

# Stop services
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f applio

# Update and rebuild
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# Remove all data (WARNING: This will delete all your models and data!)
docker compose down -v
```

### Troubleshooting

**Permission Issues:** Ensure Docker daemon is running and your user has Docker permissions.

**GPU Not Detected:** Verify NVIDIA Docker runtime is installed and configured properly.

**Port Conflicts:** Change the `APPLIO_PORT` in your `.env` file if port 6969 is in use.

**Volume Issues:** Check Docker volume permissions and available disk space.
